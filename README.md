### Eco-Analysis - Examining Global Emissions by Country/Continent

####Project Summary: Interest/intend/motivation
The aim of our project is to look in-depth into the global CO2 emissions at the country-level by 
source (coal, oil, gas, cement, flaring, other) and per capita allowing for a better understanding of
how much each country contributes to the global cumulative human impact on climate. We will 
examine relationships between emissions at the country level and GDP trends for a given year. 
We believe that global CO2 emissions matters as there is a linear relationship between the total 
amount of CO2 released by human activity and the level of warming at the Earth’s surface.

####Questions to consider:
GDP per capita by country and potential impact of global emissions
Relationship between population and per capita emissions
Per capita emissions by type (coal, gas, oil, cement, flaring, other)
How a country’s emissions level affects it’s GDP
What happens to GDP when emissions level gradually decreases

#### Technologies Used
Python Flask-powered: API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript
Database: MongoDB/SQLite

####Datasets
- CO2 emission totals and per capita for 200+ countries https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-fossil-co2-emissions-by
- GDP and population data sourced from : https://databank.worldbank.org/reports.aspx?source=world-development-indicators#   
- Continent code data:
https://datahub.io/core/continent-codes p 
- Geojson for each country sourced from:
Countries geojson was sourced from: https://datahub.io/core/geo-countries#resource-geo-countries_zip  
 
#### Project details:
Create an interactive map showing global CO2 levels at a point in time that allows users 
to visualize trends by country or continent across all fossil fuel sources
Compare/Visualize emissions by type (coal, gas, oil, cement, flaring, other) using a table,
bar chart and bubble chart
