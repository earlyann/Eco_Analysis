### Eco-Analysis - Examining Global Emissions, GDP and Population

#### Project Summary: 
The aim of our project is to look in-depth into the global CO2 emissions at the country-level by 
source (coal, oil, gas, cement, flaring, other) and per capita allowing for a better understanding of
how much each country contributes to the global cumulative human impact on climate. We will 
examine relationships between emissions at the country level and GDP trends for a given year. 
We believe that global CO2 emissions matters as there is a linear relationship between the total 
amount of CO2 released by human activity and the level of warming at the Earth’s surface.

#### Questions to consider:
- GDP per capita by country and potential impact of global emissions
- Relationship between population and per capita emissions
- Per capita emissions by type (coal, gas, oil, cement, flaring, other)
- How a country’s emissions level affects it’s GDP
- What happens to GDP when emissions level gradually decreases

#### Technologies Used
- Python/Pandas
- MongoDB
- Flask API 
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- D3
- Apex Charts


#### Datasets
- CO2 emission totals and per capita for 200+ countries: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-fossil-co2-emissions-by-country-2002-2022
- GDP and population data sourced from : https://databank.worldbank.org/reports.aspx?source=world-development-indicators#   
- Continent code data:
https://datahub.io/core/continent-codes 
- Latitude/longitude for each country sourced from: [https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/embed/dataset/world-administrative-boundaries/table/([url](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/embed/dataset/world-administrative-boundaries/table/?dataChart=eyJxdWVyaWVzIjpbeyJjb25maWciOnsiZGF0YXNldCI6IndvcmxkLWFkbWluaXN0cmF0aXZlLWJvdW5kYXJpZXMiLCJvcHRpb25zIjp7fX0sImNoYXJ0cyI6W3siYWxpZ25Nb250aCI6dHJ1ZSwidHlwZSI6ImNvbHVtbiIsImZ1bmMiOiJDT1VOVCIsInNjaWVudGlmaWNEaXNwbGF5Ijp0cnVlLCJjb2xvciI6IiNGRjUxNUEifV0sInhBeGlzIjoic3RhdHVzIiwibWF4cG9pbnRzIjo1MCwic29ydCI6IiJ9XSwidGltZXNjYWxlIjoiIiwiZGlzcGxheUxlZ2VuZCI6dHJ1ZSwiYWxpZ25Nb250aCI6dHJ1ZX0%3D))
 
 
#### Project details:
- Create an interactive map showing global CO2 levels at a point in time that allows users 
to visualize trends by country or continent across all fossil fuel sources
- Compare/Visualize emissions by type (coal, gas, oil, cement, flaring, other) using a summary table,
bar chart and bubble chart
